 <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>     
<p>
   At the end of this course, successful students will be able to do all of the following:
 </p>
 
 <ul>
  <li>Independently design programs</li>
  <li>Produce professional-quality code</li>
  <li>Implement large programs</li>
  <li>Design and execute tests to identify software bugs</li>
  <li>Repair software bugs, redesigning and refactoring code when necessary</li>
  <li>Utilize, analyze, and critique code written by others</li>
</ul>

<p>Assessment of these outcomes will be done by a combination of quizzes, exams, labs, projects, and code review.</p>


<h2>Course Requirements</h2> 

Pending. You will have a mix of labs, projects, exams, quizzes, code reviews and participation exercises.

<!-- <h4>Projects</h4>
<p>You will have six projects. In most cases, the projects will build on your other projects. A demonstration will be required for most projects. A project may only be submitted late in the case of an emergency verified by the dean's office.</p>

<h4>Exams</h4>
<p>You will have two exams. You are responsible for being present on the day of the exam.  Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency verified by the dean's office.</p>

<h4>Participation, Paper Reviews, and Quizzes</h4>
<p>You are expected to attend class, participate in class discussion, and participate in online discussion on Piazza. You will also be required to submit reviews for research papers assigned throughout the semester. <i>Pop quizzes may be administered any time. If you are not in class on the day of the quiz you will be assigned a 0 for the quiz.</i></p>

<h4>Code Review</h4>
<p>Any student may be asked to come in for code review for any assignment. A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a <strong>0</strong> on the assignment in question. A student who is unable to explain his/her code; answer the instructor's questions about his/her code; or reproduce his/her code as expected may receive a deduction of <i>up to</i> <strong>100%</strong>, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.</p>

<h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>

Pending.

<!-- <p>The final grade for this course will be calculated as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Exam 1:</strong> 20% <strong>Exam 2:</strong> 20%</p>
<p><strong>Projects:</strong> 50%</p>
<p><strong>Participation, Paper Reviews, and Quizzes:</strong> 10%</p>

<p>Please note that this is a tentative breakdown and subject to change.</p>
 -->
<h2>Letter Grades</h2> 
<p>Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:</p>


<table class="table table-condensed" style="text-align:left;">
 <tr>
  <td>A+ ≥97%</td>
  <td>B+ ≥87%</td>
  <td>C+ ≥77%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>A ≥94%</td>
<td>B ≥84%</td>
<td>C ≥74%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>A- ≥90%</td>
  <td>B- ≥80%</td>
  <td>C- ≥70%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="3">F < 70%</td>
</tr>

</table>

For example, you will receive a C letter grade if your grade is greater than or equal to 74% and less than 77%. Please note this scale is subject to change. See the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/gradstudent">Graduate Student Regulations</a> for more information about letter grades and how they are translated into GPA.  

<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, labs, and exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a>.</p>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>All deadlines are firm.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of <i>verifiable</i> medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged <i>PRIOR</i> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University of San Francisco's Academic Honor Code. Go to <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code</a> for details.</p>
<p>You must never represent another person’s work as your own.</p>
<p>Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project or homework assignment is a violation of the university’s honor code.This includes copying code or other material from the web, and having anyone other than yourself complete your assignments. It also includes working too closely with another student. Collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your solution and is a violation of the honor code.</p>
<p>Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the University Academic Integrity Committee, and a report to the Dean.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>
<p>Examples of honor code violations include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Giving your code to another student.</li>
 <li>Submitting code written by anyone other than yourself as your own.</li>
 <li>Copying text from the web.</li>
 <li>Discussing implementation details of a solution with another student.</li>
 <li>Discussing code-specific details of a solution with another student.</li>    	    
</ul>
